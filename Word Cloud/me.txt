I loved music all of my life, but it took until my late 20s to realize I had a passion for creating it, too. Being so caught up with my career and starting companies, I never took the time to explore that creative side. One day I was watching some YouTube videos on music production and the next thing I know, I am in this complete whirlwind in the studio. It wasn’t just the music though — it was a passion for creating in general from music to writing and more. Watching other people do it is what drove me to start. Sometimes, you have to say ‘Hey, I can do this too.
I discovered my unexpected passion for writing during a long spell of unemployment. It was the easiest way to express my frustrations at the time, and to record lessons I had learned for future use. At one point, it occurred to me that I could literally do this for a living with so much ease, especially considering how many pages I could write within a short time. I was encouraged to take a professional diploma course in writing. Today, creative content writing is part of my job description and I love what I do!
